- 👋 Hi, I’m Frank E Dupée, IV
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of different things. Just ask.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding. My current end goal is C# and .NET.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Check links.
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm an old school kinda guy.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... American medicine is NOT a science. ALL medical doctors in the USA have ART degrees. Don't believe me... GOOD. Go ask your own doctor. Sorry... That may not be a 'Fun' fact. Just think you have a right to know.
